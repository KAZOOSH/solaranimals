1.) wrong footprint connection of sw2 (1 and 3 are shorted. 2 and 4 are shorted.)
--> fix: cutting 2 diagonal pins after soldering the other 2 pins.

2.) Vcc is too high 
--> fix: change R2 from 330k to 650k because Vgth of Q1 in our new pool is 1.7V (before in first prototypes Vgth=1.0V) Vcc should be ca. 4.4V

3.) footprint of Q2 has wrong direction because we use now an different mosfet as Q2 (tn0604 or ZVN4206 are the better ones, BS170 the older one)
--> fix: Q2 (tn0604 or ZVN4206) is mounted like Q1
