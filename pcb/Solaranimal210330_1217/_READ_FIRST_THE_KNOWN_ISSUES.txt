1.) wrong footprint connection of sw2 (1 and 3 are shorted. 2 and 4 are shorted.)
--> fix: cutting 2 diagonal pins after soldering the other 2 pins.

2.) Vcc is too high 
--> fix: change R2 from 330k to 650k because Vgth of Q1 in our new pool is 1.7V (before in first prototypes Vgth=1.0V) Vcc should be ca. 4.4V

3.) footprint of Q2 has wrong direction because we use an different mosfet as Q2 (ZVN4206 is the new one, BS170 the older one)
--> fix: Q2 is the same direction as Q1
